## Noise & Syrup's
# 2011
- Companion to Sleep -
music for drifting while levitating air

How to begin, this is really difficult. n&s c2s(mfdwla) is an album. Well that's not true. It's a "mix-tape" but not a tape, and if I were to say it's a "mix" well it doesn't fit in the vernacular of being a Disc Jockey mix either. A little online rearch on the online internet archive shows that n&s is actually some 'free-form' (their words not mine) radio station, whatever this mean I don't know.

Sorry for boring you, I've bored myself there. The problem is these selection of tracks are very hard to describe, while they fit almost seemlessly together stiched by the delicate ear, they, all two disc set of tracks, are by entirely different artists. I'm trying to define this music without the use of cliches. This is an electronic music that does not fit in the traditional bounds of what the average or even slightly less average person would consider music. There is probably a basket of words that would be thrown at these tracks probably discrediting, what I think is a really unique take on the listening experience.

For me, these tracks are dealing with aural perpection outside of the accepted pop, rock, jazz, classical, sometimes electronic genre; even the "western tradition". Wait let's try that again. The " "western tradition" ". ... " " <em>western tradition</em> " ". Yes that old word that signifies a concept as a dog whistle to cultural supremacy.

These tracks are not locked in to an already over-exhausted set of theoretical principles. You don't know what's going on. You, the listener, have to figure it out with your ear and - if you stop paying attention - you could just miss something.

There are no Weberns leading you on a winding prodigious tour to no-where. No Bachs informing you about the cadence around the corner. No Beethovean emotional impact to the bosom - this is something very different.

Now don't get me wrong. I love the above mentioned composers but I have to tell you that this music has taken a different less traveled path of which whose compositional techniques are so new that you feel close to something wholly new, a new music encasing a new set of ideas.
