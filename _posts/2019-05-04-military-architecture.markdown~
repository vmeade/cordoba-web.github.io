I am drawn to create the spaces which I know will never exist - there on paper. There I occupy it but isn't real. Nor is there anticipation that the space will become - what only exists in the realm of ideas - here into the world of form. I am filled with a strange longing whilst seeing these images - wishing to escape into this world that is wholly in-of itself - cutoff and outside the bounds of the real. And yet it isn't so different; it's peace is the tranquilities of this world and in this way offers some respite by reminding the viewer through aesthetic appreciation some of the finer qualities that muse between the pages of ordinary.
