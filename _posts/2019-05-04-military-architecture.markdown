Well, this name floated around for awhile. I had had a Swiss historian teaching about the history of architecture and so you'd better expect there be a number of references to the history of French architecture. Viollet-le-Duc came about from discussions on theories of structuralism , which after reading this book I can understand how he's considered in reference to those ideas. Structure was the guiding principle of medieval architecture all upto the invention of artillery. Thereafter everything changed, every minute detail no longer carried the weight of it's evolutionary conception. The engineers designing the system of fortification followed a simple adage of 'that which defends should be defended' and this axiom helped guide them in post-medieval warfare but it also sprung from the full on age of castle warfares.

The book runs through a number of examples of castle that at the time, and well -er still are, in ruin but at the time he's made a case of preserving French hertiage on very good basis.  The first edition of this book was published in French in 1860. Even before that we find ourselves in the detail of, of course, the Romans. (All roads lead to Rome, as do all ideas! That's not true but fun to jest.) Anyway, Viollet wants to imprint on the reader the tradition of fortication early on, on how and why it (traditionally) has won wars. He become quite critical of the Zulu campaign sprung on by the English and says they have not followed the principles of Roman warfare that were very critical to their success throughout the ages of their empire. These principles deal in the art of a well designed and strategically placed fortication. In the most basic sense (because after all you can read the book yourself, I am not trying to reimagine it here) what was need to be done, was first a) you scout the enemy and you discover where their water source is. b) that's the strategy for placing the fortication. c) you pretty much just take thier water source and you starve them as well. Ok, this was the concept of the war. There were also principles of good design like building location and style of walls, which at that time was a rammed earth, and this rammed earth lasted very long as a technique, even some of the castle wall interiors were developed with an interior of rammed earth. The idea of the procession of the soliders in a retreat was also important to the structure. Certain area were so certain you didn't want to give them up and these ideas went on into miniscule infintesimal elaborations over the centuries. Viollet gets into the role of the castle and how it was a mainstay of the cultural identity of France. He talks about a lot of things how the aristocracy won out over the royals and different aspects about how these cutting edge technologies impacted the social order.It also becomes quite clear that the then modern national psyche of liberty and fraternity was well developed in this fertile past, in basically the cultivation of milita in defense of these castles and the urban microcosms that they began to house.

The book is interesting and there is alot to be said but it is not my goal to go indepth. Viollet leaves off at a point when he seems to have said so much about something that was largely unspoken and declares that that's enough, if someone else were to analyze these things there is still so much to be learnt.
